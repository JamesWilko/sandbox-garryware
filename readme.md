# Garryware for S&box

Multiplayer microgames! Work with or against other players in a series of rapid-fire games.
A remake of Garryware for S&box, based off of the one created by Hurricaaane for Garry's Mod.

The map used by this gamemode is also open source, [here](https://github.com/JamesWilko/sandbox-garryware-map). 
Addons and maps in S&box should use the support game/addon identifier `dhi.garryware`.

## Acknowledgements

Credit to Hurricaaane for his original gamemode, some sound effects, and the music that we shamelessly reused.
